## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

Today, you're stepping into the Reactville Burger Shop, a favorite local eatery known for its mouth-watering burgers. In this interactive app, users build their dream burger, choosing from various breads, meats, and toppings. But there's a catch: it's also a lesson in 'lifting state' in React. Get ready to stack ingredients and elevate your React skills!

In this lab, students will create a burger builder app with two main components: an ingredients list and a burger stack. Users will be able to add items from the ingredients list to the burger stack to create the perfect burger.
